# Bachelor_thesis_OE222FH_CE223AF/src/jupyter_notebook

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used during the development of the Bachelor's thesis project, "Machine Learning Against Bullying".

## Structure

The directory is structured as follows:

- `failed_experiments`: This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks of the experiments that did not yield the expected results.

- `neo4j_setup`: This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks used to set up the Neo4j database for the project.

- `succesful_experiments`: This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks of the experiments that successfully achieved their intended outcomes.

## Usage

To run these notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. If not already installed, you can do so using pip:

```sh
pip install notebook
```

Navigate to the directory of the notebook you want to run and start the Jupyter server:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

In your browser, navigate to the URL that the Jupyter server provides.

**Note:** Remember to install all required dependencies before running the notebooks. These dependencies can be found at the top of each notebook or in the `requirements.txt` file at the root of the `src` directory.
